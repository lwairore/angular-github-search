# Github Search
I once read that the average person living in a modern industrialized society is exposed to as many different pieces of information in a single day as a person living 100 years ago would have seen in a year. That includes advertisements, newspaper headlines, websites, text messages, traffic signs, T-shirt slogans, and on and on and on. It's hardly surprising that attention spans are getting shorter and that the majority of people believe themselves to be busier than ever.

With this information overload, it is next to impossible to remember everything we need to, to call up names, dates, figures, phone numbers, email addresses and all the corporate and client information we need to do business effectively. That's why we use tools to do the remembering and information retrieval for us. My company uses Salesforce.com to handle the bulk of our customer relationship management information. I use Microsoft Outlook to manage my email. When I want to find a product, service or piece of information online, I use a Search Engine.

Github search essentially act as filters for the wealth of information available on Github. It allows users to quickly and easily find information that is of geniune interest or value to the user, without the need to wade through numerous irrelevant github pages.

### About searching on GitHub
Use our powerful search tools to find what you're looking form among many repositories and users in Github.

To search for a user globally across all of Github, type the name of an existing Github username  into the the search.

We use the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to retrieve Github users information. This API allows 5,000 requests per hour with an API key, but only 60 requests per hour _without_ one.
